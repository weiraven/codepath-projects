## Notes

It took a lot of asking Copilot and tweaking to figure out the correct syntax to implement the logic for styling effect for flipping the flashcard. I started by just styling and format for a single card and then once that looked good, I spent more time consulting Copilot for creating all the functions to handle randomization and backstacking of previously shown cards, etc.
